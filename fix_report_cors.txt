Error Description:
1. CORS Policy Error: The frontend running on `http://127.0.0.1:5504` was blocked from accessing the backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8001`. Even after adding the specific origin, the error persisted, likely due to subtle origin mismatches or browser caching issues.
2. DOM Warnings: The browser console showed warnings that input elements in `register.html` were missing `autocomplete` attributes.

How It Was Fixed:
1. Updated `Backend/main.py`:
   - Changed `allowed_origins` to `["*"]` in the development environment block. This allows ANY origin to access the API during development, eliminating issues with port changes or specific origin matching. This is safe for local development.

2. Updated `Frontend/html/user/register.html`:
   - Added `autocomplete="name"` to the Name input.
   - Added `autocomplete="email"` to the Email input.
   - Added `autocomplete="tel"` to the Phone input.
   - Added `autocomplete="street-address"` to the Address input.
   - Added `autocomplete="new-password"` to the Password and Confirm Password inputs.
   - These changes resolve the browser warnings and improve user experience by enabling autofill where appropriate.

Changes Made:
- `Backend/main.py`: Replaced specific origin list with `["*"]` for development mode (approx. 14 lines removed, 1 added).
- `Frontend/html/user/register.html`: Modified 6 input fields to include autocomplete attributes.
